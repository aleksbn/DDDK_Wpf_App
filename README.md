# DDDK_Wpf_App
Frontend part of DDDK App

This was initially backend only project consisting of ASP.NET Web API and Postman requests collection, but I recently added WPF app as a frontend. 
The project is based on administrating database about blood donors organization and their data.

The principle is pretty simple: administrator can control pretty much anything, while moderator can see, add, edit or delete data about donors,, blood donations, public blood donating events and locations of these events. 
There's a readme file explaining everything you need to know in order to use it.

Project uses .NET6 as the basic framework, serilog for logging every information about the actions performed on the application, dependency injection, custom error handling system, JWT token for encryption, AutoMapper for easy conversion between DTOs and models 
and just a little bit tweaked default Authentication System.
